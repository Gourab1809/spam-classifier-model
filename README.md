Spam Classification with Machine Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and evaluate a machine learning model for spam detection. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, training multiple classifiers, and comparing their performance.

Contents
code_05_XX Spam - Classification Example.ipynb: The main notebook containing all code, analysis, and results.

Features
Text preprocessing and cleaning

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Training classifiers such as:

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Model comparison
